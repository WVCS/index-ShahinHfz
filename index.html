  <h3> Music Q&A
  </h3>
<h4>
  <li> Favorite Genre:
    My favorite genre of music is rap. I think it's a very difficult and unique type of music. The amount of talent needed to rap is absolutely insane. 
  </li>
  <li> When Do I Listen To Music:
    I usually listen to music whenever I have spare time, I just go on spotify and listen to my playlist for as long as I can. I just get lost in the music and forget about everything else. It helps you calm down and forget about all the stressful things happening in your life. Music 100% makes everything better.
 </li>
  <li> A Huge Benefit of Music:   
    I believe one of the biggest benefits music has is the opportunity it gives all these people. Some people that maybe aren't to good at school or are having trouble financially can get into music and earn some money. Although it is hard to blow up and get paid a lot, there is still a chance. Nowadays, many people are wanting to become rappers or singers and many have actually achieved their goal.</li>
